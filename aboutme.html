                    <h3>Digitize Hackathon</h3>
                        <p>For the Fall Semester in 2018, I organized and founded a hackathon for high school students in the Bay Area that provides an environment in which students can create projects that promote social good.
                            My goal was to teach students what I already know to be true: computer science is a means of helping and improving society with innovation.
                            We encourage students to focus their projects on one of our three primary hackathon themes including environmental protection, health and wellness, as well as social welfare.
                            If you are interested in learning more about this project please feel free to visit our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.digitizehackathon.tech/">website</a></p>
                    <h3>Coding Instruction</h3>
                        <p>With the knowledge I have acquired throughout my years of computer science fascination, I have been working as a coding instructor at MVCode to teach children how to program. 
                            Since women are far less represented in STEM fields, I hope to encourgae any aspiring female coders to pursue their passions, breaking gender barriers. 
                            One of the best parts of my job is that not only do I get to help these kids, but I realize that everyday I learn more and more about coding whether it is through debugging a program or maximizing runtime efficiency.</p>
                    <h3>iOS App Development</h3>
                        <p>Using XCode and Swift, I have begun programming some of my very own iOS apps. While none of them are ready to hit the App Store, I am continuously working on my code.
                            My most recent projects includes a military 3D sound training app that uses metawear sensors to adjust various artillery sounds based on the user's head position. 
                            During my summer at COSMOS, I researched sound spatialization and learned how to implement the sound aspects of virtual reality to help new recruits become accustomed to the loud noises they may encounter in the battlefield.
                            Another app I created is a AI-based tic-tac-toe game. The app allows a user to play against a computer opponent at three different skill levels ranging from easy to unbeatable. There is also a multiplayer function that allows the user to play against a friend on the same screen.
                            Finally, the last app is a budgeting app called Money Manager that helps the user track their finances and perform statistical analysises on the data to optimize budgeting efforts.
                            All of my programs are saved to my <a href="https://github.com/annazhang2002">GitHub</a> account for your viewing pleasure :)</p>
                    <h3>Video Game Development</h3>
                        <p>After studying Computer Simulations and Interactive Media at Stanford over the summer of 2017, I learned to develop and program games on Pico-8 with Lua. 
                            Now I have the skills to code my own game and can properly implement physics concepts including gravity and AI competitors.</p>
                    <h3>Web Development</h3>
                        <p>As shown by my complete website, I have learned to program in HTML and CSS to develop entire websites from scratch. I love to spend my free time coding and improving the design in my website with newer CSS concepts.</p>

                        <p>LEAP (Leaders for Environmental Awareness and Protection) Club is designed to inform students about environmental threats and how they can positively make a change. At typical meetings, I create informative presentations on particular issues such as deforestation, melting polar ice caps, and light pollution. Each presentation has a small "challenge" that suggests a simple way in which the student body can help. Moreover, we engage in projects in order to conserve the Earth. For example, we recently created an video for the student body to educate them on what can and can not be recycled. Plus, we have won the One Planet School Challenge hosted by the San Mateo County Office of Education. In the future, we hope to also plan beach clean ups, tree planting events and field trips to solar plants.</p>

                        <p>I became the SMAC Environmental Chair in 2018, and we have been planning community wide projects to help promote environmental conservation. Our most recent project is a documentary on the lead poisoning crisis in Fruitvale, CA. </p>
                    <h3>Zero-Plastic Boba Project</h3>
                        <p>Even though I am a boba tea fanatic, the thought of all the single use plastic accumulated by these companies was simply terrifying to me. Thus, I contacted a few of my local boba shops and convinced several to offer customers a discount whenever they brought in a reusable water bottle or a reusable straw! As a result, I have encouraged many people to limit their plastic usage taking small steps to lower our carbon footprints and stop ocean pollution.</p>

The trauma they face is devastating, and we wanted to spread of a message that our community supports rape survivors. Thus, we held a walkout to encourage everyone to show their support and stand with the people in our community who have been </p>
