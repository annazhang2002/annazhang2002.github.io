                    <h3>Digitize Hackathon</h3>
                        <p>For the Fall Semester in 2018, I organized and founded a hackathon for high school students in the Bay Area that provides an environment in which students can create projects that promote social good.
                            My goal was to teach students what I already know to be true: computer science is a means of helping and improving society with innovation.
                            We encourage students to focus their projects on one of our three primary hackathon themes including environmental protection, health and wellness, as well as social welfare.
                            If you are interested in learning more about this project please feel free to visit our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.digitizehackathon.tech/">website</a></p>

                    <h3>Coding Instruction</h3>
                        <p>With the knowledge I have acquired throughout my years of computer science fascination, I have been working as a coding instructor at MVCode to teach children how to program. 
                            Since women are far less represented in STEM fields, I hope to encourgae any aspiring female coders to pursue their passions, breaking gender barriers. 
                            One of the best parts of my job is that not only do I get to help these kids, but I realize that everyday I learn more and more about coding whether it is through debugging a program or maximizing runtime efficiency.</p>


                    <!--      MY EXPERIENCE WITH IOS APP DESCRIPTION          -->
                    <h3>iOS App Development</h3>
                        <p>Using XCode and Swift, I have begun programming some of my very own iOS apps. While none of them are ready to hit the App Store, I am continuously working on my code.
                            My most recent projects includes a military 3D sound training app that uses metawear sensors to adjust various artillery sounds based on the user's head position. 
                            During my summer at COSMOS, I researched sound spatialization and learned how to implement the sound aspects of virtual reality to help new recruits become accustomed to the loud noises they may encounter in the battlefield.
                            Another app I created is a AI-based tic-tac-toe game. The app allows a user to play against a computer opponent at three different skill levels ranging from easy to unbeatable. There is also a multiplayer function that allows the user to play against a friend on the same screen.
                            Finally, the last app is a budgeting app called Money Manager that helps the user track their finances and perform statistical analysises on the data to optimize budgeting efforts.
                            All of my programs are saved to my <a href="https://github.com/annazhang2002">GitHub</a> account for your viewing pleasure :)</p>

                            Now I have the skills to code my own game and can properly implement physics concepts including gravity and AI competitors.</p>

                        <p>As a member of the Network Management Team on S4CD, I have been working to build a national network of students and organization who support the bipartisan carbon dividend framework. We are currently working to collect endorsements from student body presidents at campus across the country who agree that a carbon tax must be implemented. Our goal is to accumulate voter support to show politicians that not only is this framework backed by thousands of economists, but that their voters also advocate for carbon dividends.</p>

One aspect of this project is our goal to obtain more electric vehicles for the patrol to replace the current gas cars. Moreover, we are communicating with the university officials to try and obtain more solar panels across campus to power our electric vehicles. A large portion of our work is to create a plan backed by statistics and empirical evidence for how this plan would not only benefit the planet but also would be a solid financial decision as well.</p>

                        <p>LEAP (Leaders for Environmental Awareness and Protection) Club is designed to inform students about environmental threats and how they can positively make a change. At typical meetings, I create informative presentations on particular issues such as deforestation, melting polar ice caps, and light pollution. Each presentation has a small "challenge" that suggests a simple way in which the student body can help. Moreover, we engage in projects in order to conserve the Earth. For example, we recently created an video for the student body to educate them on what can and can not be recycled. Plus, we have won the One Planet School Challenge hosted by the San Mateo County Office of Education. In the future, we hope to also plan beach clean ups, tree planting events and field trips to solar plants.</p>

                        <p>Even though I am a boba tea fanatic, the thought of all the single use plastic accumulated by these companies was simply terrifying to me. Thus, I contacted a few of my local boba shops and convinced several to offer customers a discount whenever they brought in a reusable water bottle or a reusable straw! As a result, I have encouraged many people to limit their plastic usage taking small steps to lower our carbon footprints and stop ocean pollution.</p>
